# Frontend Documentation

## Project Architecture

The frontend of this project is structured to ensure scalability, maintainability, and readability. Below is an overview of the architecture:

### Folder Structure
- **`public/`**: Contains static files such as `index.html`, icons, and other assets.
- **`src/`**: Contains the main application code.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
    - `AuthProvider.jsx`: Handles authentication context.
    - `LibroForm.jsx`: Component for adding or editing a book.
    - `LibroList.jsx`: Component for displaying a list of books.
    - `NotificationProvider.jsx`: Provides notification context for the app.
  - **`models/`**: Contains data models.
    - `Libro.js`: Represents the structure of a book object.
  - **`services/`**: Contains service files for API interactions.
    - `libroService.js`: Handles API calls related to books.
  - **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions.
    - `auth.js`: Handles authentication-related utilities.
    - `validation.js`: Contains validation logic for forms.

## Good Practices and Patterns

### 1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - The application is divided into small, reusable components to promote modularity and reusability.
   - Each component is responsible for a single piece of functionality.

### 2. **Context API for State Management**
   - The `AuthProvider` and `NotificationProvider` components use React's Context API to manage global state, such as authentication and notifications.

### 3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Logic is separated into different layers:
     - **Components**: Handle UI rendering.
     - **Services**: Handle API calls and business logic.
     - **Models**: Define the structure of data objects.
     - **Utilities**: Provide helper functions for common tasks.

### 4. **CSS Modules**
   - CSS files are scoped to individual components to avoid style conflicts.

### 5. **Error Handling**
   - API calls in `libroService.js` include error handling to ensure the app can gracefully handle failures.

### 6. **Code Quality**
   - The project follows best practices for clean and readable code:
     - Meaningful variable and function names.
     - Comments where necessary.
     - Consistent formatting and linting.

### 7. **Testing**
   - Unit tests are written for components and utilities using `App.test.js` and `setupTests.js`.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Build the project for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Implement more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Add support for internationalization (i18n).
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
